I use a simple compass that mirrors nature: earth, sun, forest, and water. Each element points to a daily practice that keeps health simple and sustainable.\\n\\n## Earth: foundations\\nStrong sleep, consistent meals, and stable energy are the bedrock. If anything feels off, we reset here first.\\n\\n## Sun: timing\\nLight tells every cell in your body what time it is. Morning sunlight, evening dimming, and movement outdoors create effortless alignment.\\n\\n## Forest: adaptation\\nThe forest is diverse and resilient. We train the same way by rotating modalities: strength, aerobic base, mobility, and skill.\\n\\n## Water: recovery\\nHydration, minerals, breathwork, and cold exposure are the recovery river. When the water flows, stress drains.\\n\\nIf you want a simple start, pick one action from each element and repeat for a week. Your body will tell you what to keep."}]}}')}}]);
