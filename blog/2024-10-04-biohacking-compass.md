Biohacking works best when it is grounded. I use a simple compass that mirrors nature: earth, sun, forest, and water. Each element points to a daily practice that keeps health simple and sustainable.

## Earth: foundations
Strong sleep, consistent meals, and stable energy are the bedrock. If anything feels off, we reset here first.

## Sun: timing
Light tells every cell in your body what time it is. Morning sunlight, evening dimming, and movement outdoors create effortless alignment.

## Forest: adaptation
The forest is diverse and resilient. We train the same way by rotating modalities: strength, aerobic base, mobility, and skill.

## Water: recovery
Hydration, minerals, breathwork, and cold exposure are the recovery river. When the water flows, stress drains.

If you want a simple start, pick one action from each element and repeat for a week. Your body will tell you what to keep.
