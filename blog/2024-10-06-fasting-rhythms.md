Fasting is a tool, not a religion. The goal is flexibility: the ability to burn fat, use glucose, and recover well.

### A simple weekly rhythm
- **Mon–Thu:** 14–16 hour overnight fasts, protein-forward first meal.
- **Fri:** Early dinner, gentle 12-hour fast to protect sleep.
- **Sat:** Fuel for sport or training; no intentional fast.
- **Sun:** Optional 18–20 hour reset if energy and mood feel steady.

### Notes
- Hydrate with minerals during longer fasts.
- Keep training intensity lower on longer fast days.
- Refeed with protein, fiber, and whole-food carbs.

If this feels good for two weeks, we can personalize with biomarkers and training load.
