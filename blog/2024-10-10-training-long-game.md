Longevity training is not extreme training. It is repeatable, joint-friendly, and still powerful.

## Two anchors
1. **Strength:** 2–3 full-body sessions per week.
2. **Aerobic base:** 2–4 sessions of easy, nasal-breathing cardio.

## What this builds
- Muscle as metabolic armor
- Mitochondrial density and stamina
- Faster recovery between life stressors

If you want a start, try two strength days and two 30-minute zone-2 sessions for three weeks.
