Your sleep system is light-driven. When light is right, hormones follow.

## Morning
- 5–10 minutes of outdoor light within an hour of waking.
- Keep caffeine for after your first light exposure.

## Evening
- Dim overhead lights 2 hours before bed.
- Use warm lamps and avoid bright screens.

## Night
- Keep the room cool and dark.
- If you wake, use low red light only.

If you want help dialing this in, I can build a simple light map for your home.
