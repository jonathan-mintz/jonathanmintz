description: A decade of small choices that reshaped my health from the inside out.

About 12 years ago I began a process that didn’t look dramatic from the outside, but changed my life from the inside.
It wasn’t one “moment of awakening,” but a series of small, consistent decisions that kept adding up.
I realized something simple:
I didn’t lack information — I lacked daily practice.

## The first things that left
Gradually, not all at once, I removed:
- 🚭 Cigarettes
- 🍭 Processed sugar
- 🍔 Processed food
- 🌿 Cannabis

Not out of struggle, but out of listening.
I noticed how my body responded, how my energy shifted, how my mind cleared.

## Healing that didn’t come from a pill
Over the years I dealt with:
- Recurring sports injuries
- Hormonal imbalance
- Fatigue that wouldn’t go away

Instead of chasing a quick fix, I started asking:
How do I sleep?
How do I eat?
How do I train?
How do I recover?

Through smart movement, simple nutrition, reducing unnecessary load, and listening to my body — real healing began.
Not magic. A process.

## The current station: alcohol
In recent years another step was added to the journey — a gradual reduction of alcohol.
The deeper I learn, the clearer it becomes that even small amounts of alcohol:
- Disrupt the gut microbiome
- Affect white matter in the brain
- Load the liver
- Impact recovery, sleep, and overall balance

I’m not saying I’ll never drink wine.
I do enjoy wine.
But today the choice is conscious, minimal, and not automatic.

## What really changed?
The biggest thing I learned is this:
Real change doesn’t start with what you stop —
it starts with what you build in its place.

More presence.
More connection to the body.
More honesty with yourself.

And it’s a process.
Even after 12 years — it’s still ongoing.
