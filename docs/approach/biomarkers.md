title: Biomarkers That Matter
---

You do not need a hundred data points. We focus on the signals that change outcomes.

## Core markers
- Resting heart rate and HRV trends
- Fasting glucose and A1c
- Lipid profile with ApoB
- Vitamin D, ferritin, and B12 when needed

## How we use them
- Look for direction, not perfection.
- Track trends across weeks, not days.
- Pair lab data with sleep and training feedback.
