title: Vision & Method
---

My work is grounded in the elements: earth, sun, forest, water. Each one becomes a simple, repeatable practice you can live with.

- **Earth:** stable foundations, sleep, consistent meals, and recovery.
- **Sun:** timing, light exposure, and circadian rhythm.
- **Forest:** diverse movement, adaptation, and resilience.
- **Water:** hydration, minerals, and nervous system calm.

We start with what you can sustain, then test and personalize.
