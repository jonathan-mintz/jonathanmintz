title: Weekly Fasting Cycle
---

Here is a simple rhythm that works for many people:

- **Mon–Thu:** 14–16 hour overnight fasts.
- **Fri:** 12-hour fast to protect sleep.
- **Sat:** Fuel for sport and social meals.
- **Sun:** Optional 18–20 hour reset.

Adjust based on energy, mood, and training load.
