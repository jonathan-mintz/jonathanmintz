title: Fasting Foundations
---

Fasting is a way to improve metabolic flexibility and simplify nutrition. It should feel calm, not extreme.

## Principles
- Start with a consistent overnight fast (12–14 hours).
- Keep protein high at the first meal.
- Hydrate with water and minerals.
- Align longer fasts with lower training intensity.
