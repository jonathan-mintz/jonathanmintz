description: Biohacking, fasting, and sport for long, healthy living.

Welcome. I work with people who want to feel strong, think clearly, and extend their healthspan. The focus is practical biohacking: light, movement, nutrition, sleep, and smart recovery.

## What we do
- Build resilient energy with simple daily rhythms.
- Train for longevity: strength, aerobic base, and mobility.
- Use fasting and nutrition to improve metabolic flexibility.
- Track the right biomarkers without obsession.

If you are new, start with the **Foundations** and **Fasting** sections. The **Documents** folder has templates you can use immediately.
